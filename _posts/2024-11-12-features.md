## **Features**

### **1. Security-Oriented Focus**
- **Delveline** excels as a security analysis tool, offering the ability to detect vulnerabilities such as:
    - Non-thread-safe data structures (e.g., `HashMap`, `ArrayList`, `StringBuilder`, etc) in multi-threading scenarios.
    - Hardcoded sensitive data like API tokens, passwords, private keys, etc.
    - Command Injection.
    - SQL Injection.
    - XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Weak Cryptographic such as MD5 or SHA-1 are considered vulnerable because they can be easily cracked..
    - Dependency Vulnerability Detection (OSV.dev).

  **OSV.dev**, backed by Google, provides an extensive database for detecting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in dependencies and libraries used in your project. This enables **Delveline** to identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies more effectively.

- **Coming soon (open contribution)**
    - Insecure Http connection : Because unencrypted HTTP connections for sensitive data communication can cause data to be leaked or intercepted by third parties.
    - Reflection Class Vulnerability: Reflection can cause vulnerabilities if it allows access or modification of sensitive classes and methods without adequate controls.
    -  Insecure Deserialization

### **2. Industry Standards and Vulnerability Scoring**
We leverage:
- [CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/slices/699.html): A global standard for identifying and categorizing vulnerabilities.
- [CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0): A framework for scoring the severity of vulnerabilities.
- [OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)](https://google.github.io/osv.dev/): A comprehensive database for open-source vulnerability information.
- **ISO/IEC 27001 Alignment**: Supporting security awareness and risk management practices aligned with global information security standards.

> **Disclaimer**: Delveline may not identify all vulnerabilities but serves as a powerful first step in securing your codebase.


<!-- ### **3. Runtime-Assisted Static Analysis**
- **Delveline** employs a unique **runtime-assisted static analysis** approach, allowing static analysis to be supplemented by runtime data, making it more adaptive than purely static tools. -->

### **3. Flexible integration**
- **Delveline** can be installed as a Gradle plugin or used as a Java/Kotlin library.
